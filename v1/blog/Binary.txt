# What is Binary?

We've all heard that computers do everything in numbers or everything in ones and zeros. 
I'm looking at my editor (vim) and honestly, it doesn't look like a bunch of numbers, just words. 
What then does this mean? How can things like text be 'numbers' under the hood?

## Bases of Numbers

When we count, we have a concept of digits. 
There are ten symbols (0-9) and when we get to the end of them, we represent the number with *two* such symbols.
The first symbol is the 'tens' and the second is the 'ones.'
You know this&mdash;if you're a human in the twenty-first century then you probably use numbers greater than ten on a daily basis&mdash;so why am I telling you this?
Well there's nothing particularly special about the number ten.
