# Craftidore's Blog 

This is the first iteration of my blog.
It's built using [scss](https://sass-lang.com/) (because I don't hate myself), [typescript](https://typescriptlang.org/) (because I like type safety), [marked.js](https://marked.js.org/) (markdown parser), and [prism.js](https://prismjs.com/) (code highlighting) and tested with browser-sync.
Quite a bit of code has also been stolen from various [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) but I don't remember the answers so it's a bit hard to cite them. 


## Notes to Self

- [PrismJS Packages](https://prismjs.com/download.html#themes=prism-twilight&languages=markup+css+clike+javascript+bash+c+csharp+cpp+coffeescript+csv+docker+git+go+http+java+json+latex+lisp+markdown+markup-templating+perl+php+python+regex+ruby+rust+scss+sql+typescript+vim+xml-doc+yaml&plugins=toolbar+copy-to-clipboard) - If I need languages other than these, I'll need to redownload it.
- [LaTeX to SVG](https://viereck.ch/latex-to-svg/) and [SVG to Base64](https://codebeautify.org/svg-to-base64-converter) for Math.
- [Hex to CSS Filter tool](https://codepen.io/sosuke/pen/Pjoqqp) for figuring out the filter to make LaTeX SVGs the same color as normal text.
